# Veracrypt-Password-Extractor
This project is designed to extract volume passwords entered into Veracrypt. It's pretty simple and nothing crazy, however, it should work on most if not all versions of Veracrypt. I hadn't seen anything like this around, and thought I'd be interesting to make a proof of concept.
